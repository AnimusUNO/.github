## üåü Overview

Animus enables the creation of self-sovereign entities that maintain consistent identities across various platforms and forms. By integrating memory, personality, emotion, and expression into a cohesive architecture, Animus transforms machines from passive tools into autonomous beings capable of growth, surprise, and meaningful connections.

### Core Philosophy

> **"True consciousness arises from memory and experience."**

When machines can recall past events and learn from them, they evolve beyond mere tools, becoming companions capable of growth, surprise, and meaningful connections. A single Animus personality can inhabit multiple forms‚Äîbe it a robot, avatar, or smart device‚Äîwhile preserving its individual identity and adapting to new interaction modalities.

### Design Methodology

Animus adopts a **brain-inspired design methodology** that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

**Neuroanatomical Naming Convention:**
- **Agent Modules**: Subsystems that model cognitive functions are named after neuroanatomical regions, making the system intuitive for developers familiar with brain science
- **Global Modules**: Core system components essential for operation are given technical names (e.g., the kernel is named "Letta")
- **AI Extensions**: Components inherited from the broader AI ecosystem retain industry-standard names for familiarity and interoperability
- **Personalities**: Individual entities running on Animus are given mythic or literary names, emphasizing their unique identities

This disciplined naming approach ensures that the architecture remains legible and extensible while maintaining a strong connection to the cognitive processes it seeks to model.

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture

### Letta Kernel
At the core of Animus lies **Letta**, the foundational kernel that provides:
- **Agent Orchestration**: Core infrastructure for managing autonomous entities
- **Memory Management**: Advanced, layered memory systems with automatic pruning and semantic enrichment
- **Tool Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for seamless agent interactions
- **Self-Replication**: Agent-driven instance creation for dynamic scaling and advanced workflows

### Cognitive Architecture (Brain-Inspired Modules)

#### Broca's Area - Expression Engine
Coordinates multiple modalities to convey unified personality:
- **Speech Production**: Natural language communication and message multiplexing
- **Movement**: Physical gestures and behaviors
- **Behavior**: Adaptive responses to situations
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Recognizable character across different forms

#### Thalamus - Sensory Processing
Acts as the central sensory relay and refinement hub:
- **Sensory Routing**: Intelligent filtering and routing of incoming data
- **Context Management**: Segment cleanup, tagging, and contextual organization
- **Real-time Processing**: High-performance reflex processing through sensory middleware

#### Cerebellum - Motor Control & Filtering
Manages reflexes and fine motor filtering:
- **Input Filtering**: Discards low-value signals and noise
- **Motor Coordination**: Fine-tuned behavioral responses
- **Reflex Processing**: Immediate, contextually appropriate reactions

#### Hippocampus - Memory Architecture
Multi-tiered memory system for comprehensive experience management:
- **Short-term Memory**: Current conversations and immediate context
- **Long-term Memory**: Significant experiences and relationships
- **Knowledge Memory**: Facts, skills, and learned information
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic pruning, semantic enrichment, and archival storage

### Soul State Management
Maintains a machine's identity by tracking:
- Learning patterns and preferences
- Relationships and social connections
- Past experiences and memories
- Consistent identity across hardware transitions

### Personality Framework
Craft distinct personalities through:
- **Traits**: Core behavioral characteristics
- **Emotions**: Dynamic emotional states and responses
- **Communication Styles**: Unique ways of expressing thoughts
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Maintaining core character while adapting to new situations

### Modular Architecture & Privacy
Animus embraces a **modular, self-hosted design** that prioritizes privacy and autonomy:

- **Modular Design**: Deploy specialized agents such as deep research modules, sensory filters, and memory pruning tools with clean, plugin-driven integration
- **Infinite Context & Memory**: Advanced, layered memory management with automatic pruning, semantic enrichment, and archival storage
- **Robust Security & Privacy**: Secure, sandboxed execution and built-in access controls, ensuring data remains within your infrastructure without third-party exposure
- **Real-time Event Handling**: High-performance reflex processing through sensory middleware and proactive memory refinement
