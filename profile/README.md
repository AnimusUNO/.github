## üåü What is Animus?

Animus is an open, extensible framework for designing and deploying LLM-driven physical agents with layered memory, persistent personality, and brain-inspired modularity. Whether you're building interactive robots, autonomous digital companions, or adaptive agents for smart devices, Animus provides the foundation for systems that feel genuinely alive.

It integrates a modular, neuro-inspired architecture, a robust CLI, and a developer-friendly interface to create agents that can learn, evolve, and maintain their own unique identities ‚Äî across any embodiment, digital or physical.

### Why Animus?

> **Animus isn't just another AI framework‚Äîit's the only open platform designed around human-inspired cognition, persistent memory, and full data sovereignty.** Build agents that aren't disposable chatbots: Animus agents remember, adapt, and maintain identity across hardware, sessions, and environments. Modular neuro-inspired design means you can extend, swap, or fork any cognitive subsystem‚Äîno vendor lock-in, no black-box magic. Total control, true personality, real continuity‚Äîbecause your agents should be more than stateless parrots.

### Design Methodology

Animus adopts a **brain-inspired design methodology** that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

**Neuroanatomical Naming Convention:**
- **Agent Modules**: Subsystems that model cognitive functions are named after neuroanatomical regions, making the system intuitive for developers familiar with brain science
- **Global Modules**: Core system components essential for operation are given technical names (e.g., the kernel is named "Letta")
- **AI Extensions**: Components inherited from the broader AI ecosystem retain industry-standard names for familiarity and interoperability
- **Personalities**: Individual entities running on Animus are given mythic or literary names, emphasizing their unique identities

This disciplined naming approach ensures that the architecture remains legible and extensible while maintaining a strong connection to the cognitive processes it seeks to model.
