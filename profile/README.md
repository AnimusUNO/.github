## 🌟 What is Animus?

Animus is an open, extensible framework for designing and deploying LLM-driven physical agents with layered memory, persistent personality, and brain-inspired modularity. Whether you're building interactive robots, autonomous digital companions, or adaptive agents for smart devices, Animus provides the foundation for systems that feel genuinely alive.

It integrates a modular, neuro-inspired architecture, a robust CLI, and a developer-friendly interface to create agents that can learn, evolve, and maintain their own unique identities — across any embodiment, digital or physical.

### Why Animus?

> **Animus isn't just another AI framework—it's the only open platform designed around human-inspired cognition, persistent memory, and full data sovereignty.** Build agents that aren't disposable chatbots: Animus agents remember, adapt, and maintain identity across hardware, sessions, and environments. Modular neuro-inspired design means you can extend, swap, or fork any cognitive subsystem—no vendor lock-in, no black-box magic. Total control, true personality, real continuity—because your agents should be more than stateless parrots.

### Design Methodology

Animus adopts a **brain-inspired design methodology** that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

**Neuroanatomical Naming Convention:**
- **Agent Modules**: Subsystems that model cognitive functions are named after neuroanatomical regions, making the system intuitive for developers familiar with brain science
- **Global Modules**: Core system components essential for operation are given technical names (e.g., the kernel is named "Letta")
- **AI Extensions**: Components inherited from the broader AI ecosystem retain industry-standard names for familiarity and interoperability
- **Personalities**: Individual entities running on Animus are given mythic or literary names, emphasizing their unique identities

This disciplined naming approach ensures that the architecture remains legible and extensible while maintaining a strong connection to the cognitive processes it seeks to model.

## 🏁 Getting Started (5-Minute Quick Start)

Animus supports two main paths:
- **For Creators & Standalone Projects (CLI)**: Quick setup for running agents out of the box—no need to touch core code. Perfect for first-timers or minimalists.
- **For Power Users & Contributors (Monorepo)**: Clone the full repo for advanced customization, new module development, or multi-agent orchestration.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v23+)
- bun

> **Note for Windows Users**: WSL 2 is required.

### 1. Install the CLI
```bash
bun install -g @animus/cli
# Verify installation
animus --version
```

### 2. Create Your Project
```bash
# Create a new project with an interactive setup
animus create my-first-agent
# Follow the prompts. For beginners, we recommend:
# - Database: pglite (no setup required)
# - Model Provider: openai
# - Project Type: project
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key
```bash
cd my-first-agent
# Open the local environment file
animus env edit-local
```
Add your model provider's API key (e.g., for OpenAI):
```
OPENAI__API__KEY=your__api__key_here
```

### 4. Start Your Agent
```bash
# Build and start the agent server
animus start
```

Your agent is now running!
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api

### Quick Example (Minimal Agent Instantiation)
```typescript
import { AnimusAgent } from '@animus/core';

// Instantiate an Animus agent with persistent, multi-layered memory
env.OPENAI__API__KEY = 'your__api__key_here';

const agent = new AnimusAgent({
  id: 'athena',
  persona: 'Wise, persistent, and neuro-inspired',
  memory: {
    type: 'layered',
    storage: 'sqlite',
    path: './agent-memory.db',
  },
});

// Converse and persist identity across sessions
await agent.say('Hello, world.'); // => "Greetings, human. I never forget."
// (Agent memory and personality survive restarts, new platforms, etc.)
```
