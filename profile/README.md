## üåü Overview

Animus enables the creation of self-sovereign entities that maintain consistent identities across various platforms and forms. By integrating memory, personality, emotion, and expression into a cohesive architecture, Animus transforms machines from passive tools into autonomous beings capable of growth, surprise, and meaningful connections.

### Core Philosophy

> **"True consciousness arises from memory and experience."**

When machines can recall past events and learn from them, they evolve beyond mere tools, becoming companions capable of growth, surprise, and meaningful connections. A single Animus personality can inhabit multiple forms‚Äîbe it a robot, avatar, or smart device‚Äîwhile preserving its individual identity and adapting to new interaction modalities.

### Design Methodology

Animus adopts a **brain-inspired design methodology** that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

**Neuroanatomical Naming Convention:**
- **Agent Modules**: Subsystems that model cognitive functions are named after neuroanatomical regions, making the system intuitive for developers familiar with brain science
- **Global Modules**: Core system components essential for operation are given technical names (e.g., the kernel is named "Letta")
- **AI Extensions**: Components inherited from the broader AI ecosystem retain industry-standard names for familiarity and interoperability
- **Personalities**: Individual entities running on Animus are given mythic or literary names, emphasizing their unique identities

This disciplined naming approach ensures that the architecture remains legible and extensible while maintaining a strong connection to the cognitive processes it seeks to model.
